Sure you have. That's what I made this for.\r\n\r\n###How to use\r\nClone to desktop, stick the script in the folder where the extracted Landsat Geotiffs are located. Make sure to examine the metadata and enter the correct variable values into the bottom of the python script. Run it. If everything goes well it may look as if the script is unresponsive for a minute. Don't worry--magic is happening and you'll soon be the proud owner of a beaming baby LST image.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
