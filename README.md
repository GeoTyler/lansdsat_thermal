Python utility for converting Landsat 5 and 7 thermal bands from Digital Numbers 
to Land Surface Temperature in Degrees Kelvin and Degrees Celcisus

##Why use this?
Have you ever wanted to just quickly convert a Landsat thermal band image from digital number to a more audience-friendly 
land-surface temperature, but didn't know how, didn't want to go through all the trouble, or didn't want to do it in 
some proprietary desktop GIS or remote sensing suite? Sure you have. That's what I made this for.

##How to use
  * Clone to desktop
  * Stick the script in the folder where the extracted Landsat Geotiffs are located
  * Make sure to examine the metadata and enter the correct variable values into the bottom of the python script
  * Run it
  * If everything goes well it may look as if the script is unresponsive for a minute. Don't worry--magic is happening and you'll soon be the proud owner of a beaming baby LST image.
